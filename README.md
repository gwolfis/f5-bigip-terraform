# F5 BIG-IP in Azure by using Terraform

**This is a community based project. As such, F5 does not provide any offical support for this project**

This collection of Terraform scripts are focussed on how to deploy an F5 BIG-IP into Azure public cloud.

There are two sections available:
- Azure Quick Starts;
- Azure Use Cases.

## Azure Quick Starts

Quick starts are developed to deliver a quick and easy way to deploy F5 BIG-IP solutions in Azure. It provides a full deployment, including a BIG-IP configuration which delivers application services like availability, health, SSL/TLS offloading and application security, together with a demo application.

One or more F5 BIG-IPs will get deployed in a pre-canned design and provide a full functional solution by just deploying the Terraform script.

Delivered pre-canned designs are:
- Stand-Alone;
- Failover;
- auto-scale.
